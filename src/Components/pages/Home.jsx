                        Certificates of Merit are printed using high technology print solutions. This is to make the process of creating fraudulent certificates as difficult as possible. However,<br />
                        with the current pace at which technology is advancing, it is easy for anyone to create duplicates of certificates printed even as recently as 24 months back. There is<br />
                        no method of preventing a high-tech crook from duplicating even a new certificate printed using cutting edge technology. The reason is that these certificates are<br />
                        static in nature and cannot dynamically morph themselves to take advantage of newer technology as they become available. To overcome this difficulty, UIAS™ was<br />
                        conceived as a living certificate system.<br /><br />
                        UIAS™ uses the most comprehensive cutting-edge technology available on any given date to prevent fraud. The advantage of UIAS™ is its ability to apply all<br />
                        technology upgrades to all documents within it, regardless of when these documents were generated.<br /><br />
                        UIAS™ is a Document Authentication System developed in consultation with a number of Universities and Academic Institutions to infuse cutting-edge technology to<br />
                        prevent fraud in Certificates issued by Universities and other relevant institutions. UIAS™ is a comprehensive integrated suite of applications that ensures that only<br />
                        certificates issued by competent authorities are generated on-line with options to produce hard copies simultaneously.<br /><br />
                        UIAS™ encrypts, dematerializes and disintegrates each document and all associated details before moving it onto the clustered multi-location servers of the<br />
                        UIASVault ™. The UIASGAG™ (UIAS™ Global Access Gateway) is the interface that provides users access to the UIASVault™ to verify authenticity of documents in the<br />
                        UIASVault™. Anyone can invoke UIASGAG™ using an Internet Browser. For optimum performance, use Netscape V.5.0 or above or Internet Explorer V.4.0 or above.<br />
                        Universities that choose UIAS™ offer their Alumni a positive guarantee that Fraudulent Certificates are not likely to reduce the value of their merit certificates. Such<br />
                        Alumni have the additional advantage of not having to present original/Xeroxed paper certificates as these can be viewed by anyone with the UIASCode™ for these<br />
                        certificates, over the Internet. The UIASCode™ is a unique identification code assigned to each document in the UIASVault™.
